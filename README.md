# Part 0: Fundamentals of Web App

This repository contains all the completed exercise of the Part 0 of Full Stack Open.
In this part, we mainly learn the, like the title said, fundamentals of web app, like Ajax, the traditional way of creating a web app or website, and the Single Page App, and their differences.

The exercises here are mainly diagrams representing what's going on when a user goes to specific page or use a form to send data on those page. With those exercises, I've deepen the understanding of what's behind the web app and web site.
